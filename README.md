# The Odin Project: Admin Dashboard

## The Project 
- This project is a dummy admin dashboard built to showcase what I have learned about CSS Grid
- The aim of this project is to lean in CSS Grid as much as possible (as opposed to CSS Flexbox)
- Although responsive design is not compulsory, this project is aimed to be responsive 
- Media query is used to make this site on the smaller screen (smaller than 600px) responsive
- clamp() and calc() are widely used in this project in order to achieve the repsonsive design
- repeat() and minmax() are also widely used inside Grid properties
- All links in "My Projects" section and "Trending" section are real as theyâ€™re intended
- All png icons and pictures are made by me with PhotoShop CC
- Although I am far from expert, I have accessibility in mind when working on this project. Things such as giving up on removing the input field's outline because I have learned that by doing so screen reader users will not be able to see where their pointer is focused

# Sidebar
- The sidebar in this project has two main sections to for different options

# Option Menu
- Two main layers are living inside the option menu
- The top layers has an input for search function, and the main profile option on the right
- The bottom layer is a secondary profile section contains user name and greeting

# My Projects
- All links here are real as mentioned above, which will bring users to my other projects
- I have learned that removing link's underline decoration is a bad practice in general, so instead I made the underline shows up upon hovering. Also a ">" sign is added on each project title to make it obvious that they are clickable links for users

# Annnouncements
- All links here are empty links

# Trending
- All links are real and will redirect users to different Wikipedia pages
